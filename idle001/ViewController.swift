// Make a store

// Store has

/*
 
 A store has superBucks. We should call them currencty. But the fact that I can write tihngs out and call them somsething and change it later makes me think I can do that.
 
 Then the store has  something thatI wan tot call teh currecny. Over time it has to do tsomething. I want to bmake sur ehta the user is getting this amount of money that is added to his account ove time. There shoudl be a call on teh times between whent eh app was reopened and when ti was las used. That is omething to keep a s the user goes throught e jrpocess of using the appl.
 
 I should look at the document that we wrote up.
